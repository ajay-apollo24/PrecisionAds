```typescript
const filters = {
  organizationId: 'org-123',
  startDate: new Date('2024-01-01'),
  endDate: new Date('2024-01-31'),
  groupBy: 'day'
};

const analytics = await analyticsService.getPerformanceAnalytics(filters);
```

### Compare Campaigns
```typescript
const comparison = await analyticsService.compareCampaigns(
  'org-123',
  ['campaign-1', 'campaign-2', 'campaign-3']
);
```

### Create Custom Report
```typescript
const report = await analyticsService.createCustomReport(
  'org-123',
  'Monthly Revenue Report',
  'Revenue analysis by month',
  'SELECT DATE_TRUNC(\'month\', date) as month, SUM(revenue) as total_revenue FROM revenue_analytics GROUP BY month',
  '0 0 1 * *' // Monthly on the 1st
);
```

## Service Architecture

The module uses a service-based architecture with:

- **AnalyticsService**: Core business logic for all analytics operations
- **Route Handlers**: HTTP endpoint handlers that use the service
- **Data Models**: Prisma models for data persistence
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error handling across all endpoints

## Performance Considerations

- **Caching**: Implement Redis caching for frequently accessed analytics
- **Database Indexing**: Proper indexing on date, organization, and campaign fields
- **Query Optimization**: Use efficient SQL queries with proper grouping
- **Pagination**: Support for large datasets with pagination

## Security

- **Organization Isolation**: All queries are scoped to the requesting organization
- **Input Validation**: Proper validation of all input parameters
- **Query Sanitization**: Safe execution of custom SQL queries
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against abuse
