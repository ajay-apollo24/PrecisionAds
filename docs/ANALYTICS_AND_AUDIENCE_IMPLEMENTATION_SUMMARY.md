## Architecture Patterns

### Service Layer Pattern
Both modules follow a clean service layer architecture:
- **Routes**: Handle HTTP requests and responses
- **Services**: Contain business logic and data operations
- **Models**: Prisma models for data persistence
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling with proper HTTP status codes

### Data Flow
1. **Request**: HTTP request comes in with organization context
2. **Validation**: Input validation and organization ID verification
3. **Service Call**: Route calls appropriate service method
4. **Data Processing**: Service performs business logic and data operations
5. **Response**: Formatted response with proper error handling
